			<p>Welcome to Hiruevan Stuido! This is where games created by Hiruevan (Regardless of for which company) are posted and recorded here. This is a cool place to see what I (Hiruevan) am up to and play my games. You can find them using the navigation bar above, and you can see all that I have been up to.</p>

			<h2>Current Projects</h2>
			<p>I am currently working on many different games. Some of them I will not list because they are not far enough in development to be anounced. Here are the soon to be posted games:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Revenge</li>
					<li>Snake Reimagined</li>
					<li>Surge (This game has been delayed due to the unability to work with the team on this game)</li>
					<li>Color System (This is not a game, but will support many in the future when it is finished)</li>
				</ul>
			<p>I hope that you are all just as exicted as me to finish these awsome projects. Expect much more and better games in the future as I improve my programming skills. I may also create some tutorials, who knows? I hope this will continue to be productive.</p>
